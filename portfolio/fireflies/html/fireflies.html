      Fireflies’s Cave is a room-escape game designed with interactive technology. The room is set to be an ancient cave
  with a dry river bed beneath. The plot of the game is inspired by characters and stories from ancient Greek
  mythology. Focusing on user experience, I design the interactions that combine the real and virtual worlds, and
  devote to create an immersive experience.

  respondents has played room-escape games more than once this year.

      The key of the story is light. I have come up with more than 10 levels and each
       level has a game related to light including the physical properties of light
        and different types of light source (lightning, fire, stars, fireflies etc).
        I quickly sketched some storyboards from brainstorming.

        I have analyzed the logic of the story and made it more reasonable. More details
         are added to this version in order to tell a complete story. I also think about
         the technologies, especially in tangible medias, and exam the technical
         feasibility in each level.

        I find this story is kind of tedious after showing to some players. Paying too much
         attention on level setting, I neglect designing the plot. Start-development-climax-end
          is the classical paradigm in story creating. In my work however, there are too many
          highlights bringing equal stimulations, which may lead to confusion or fatigue.
          In order to create a better experience for player not only in the plot but also
          in the interactive design, I am rethinking about the storyboard.
